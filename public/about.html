                <h2>Hey, I'm Jorge</h2>
                <p>I'm a lot of things. It's often difficult to describe myself, because I don't necessarily think I neatly fit into any one bucket. But here I'll try.</p>
                <p>I was the first generation in my family to learn English, live in the US, attend university, and have any sort of career for myself. Here's a picture of me with my parents.</p>
                <p>They taught me all the important things in life. They taught me what they could. How to love, how to work, that I should study, and instilled in me the desire to want more for myself and my future.</p>
                <p>In all honestly, this is probably all for them. They probably won't use much of what I build, or even understand it. But the fact remains that I know they're deeply proud of my accomplishments and capabilities and are so happy I have set a great foundation for the rest of my life.</p>
